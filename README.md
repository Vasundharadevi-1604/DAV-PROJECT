# 🌾 Agricultural Data Analysis & Visualization

This project analyzes crop yield and production trends across Indian states using historical agricultural data. Through exploratory data analysis and rich visualizations, it identifies top-performing crops, compares state-wise productivity, and explores temporal yield patterns over the years.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

--Data preprocessing and cleaning of crop yield datasets.

--Exploratory data analysis (EDA) on various crops, years, and states.

--Interactive and static visualizations using libraries like Matplotlib and Seaborn.

--Yield trend analysis for major crops over time.

--State-wise comparison of crop productivity.

---

## 📊 Key Features

--Data Cleaning: Handling missing values and removal of invalid records.

--Crop-wise Analysis: Yield comparison of various crops across states.

--State-wise Trends: How different states perform across years and crops.

--Time Series Trends: Visualizing yield patterns over time.

--Interactive Exploration: Easily adaptable for specific crop/state/year.
