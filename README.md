# 🌍 Climate Change Impact in India  
### Temperature Trends Across Indian States (1901–2015) – Data Analysis & Visualization

This project investigates climate change trends across Indian states using historical temperature data from 1901 to 2015. Leveraging data visualization and exploratory analysis, it identifies states with the highest temperature increases and highlights patterns over time.

---

## 📌 Features of the Project:

### ✅ Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
- Removing missing values
- Converting data types
- Verifying and filtering by year/state

### 🔍 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Analyzing temperature change over time
- Identifying states with the highest warming trends
- Comparing average temperatures across Indian states

### 📊 Visualizations using Matplotlib & Seaborn
- **Line plots** to show yearly trends for top 10 hottest states
- **Bar charts** to compare average temperature by state
- **Heatmaps** to visualize regional temperature change over decades

## 📂 Dataset:

The dataset includes **average annual temperatures** for Indian states from **1901 to 2015**. It is derived from NASA GISS-based sources and adapted for state-level analysis.

---

## 🛠 Technologies Used:
- **Python**
- **Pandas, NumPy** (for data manipulation)
- **Matplotlib, Seaborn** (for visualization)
- **Google Colab** (for cloud-based execution)

---

## 📝 How to Use:
1. Open the `.ipynb` file in Google Colab or Jupyter Notebook.
2. Run cells sequentially to:
   - Upload and load the dataset
   - Perform data exploration and cleaning
   - Visualize state-wise temperature trends
3. Modify the code to explore additional states, time periods, or patterns.

---

## 📈 Key Insights:
- States like **Rajasthan, Gujarat, and Tamil Nadu** have seen significant warming.
- Overall warming trend observed in nearly all states from 1901 to 2015.
- Data insights can help drive **policy decisions** and **climate resilience planning**.
